demo
====

Demo is a tool for live presentation, that displays at the same time output from console (interpreter) coupled with other content (slides). It's inspired by something similar used by David Beazley during his `Builtin Superheroes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VSAsKAj98>`_ presentation from keynote talk at PyData Chicago 2016.

Currently under a rapid development, any changes to the API may be done without further notice.
